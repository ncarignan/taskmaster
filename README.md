* Include a displayed "submitted!" label on the page when the user clicks the "submit" button
* [Build the "All Tasks" page](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-java-guide/curriculum/class-26/taskmaster_all_tasks.png)
* Include an image with a back button - no functionality needed at this point
* Create directory called screenshots
* Build unit tests for any testable code at this point

### Tuesday
* Create a Settings page. It should allow users to enter their username and hit save.
* Modify the main page to contain three different buttons with hardcoded task titles. 
* When a user taps one of the titles, it should go to the Task Detail page, and the title at the top of the page should match the task title that was tapped on the previous page.
* The homepage should also contain a button to visit the Settings page, and once the user has entered their username, it should display “{username}’s tasks” above the three task buttons.
* Update homepage screenshot and add a screenshot of Task Detail page.
* Build unit tests for any testable code at this point
* Allow the user to specify on their settings page how many tasks should be shown on the homepage. Use this to dynamically create buttons for as many tasks as the user requests.
